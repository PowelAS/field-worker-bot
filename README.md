# Field Worker Bot

This is the project created by Powel team during Microsoft Bot Framework Hackfest in Microsoft Norway, Oslo, March 2017. 
The project contains a bot application hosted in ASP.NET Web API and a Xamarin client application. 

## Purpose of the project

Field Worker Bot is a Proof-of-Concept for field workers performing power grid inspections. In many cases the field workers are not able to add discrepancies to their systems using traditional web or mobile applications, when they inspect components in the power grid. Difficult conditions like work at height, dirt and frost force them to add this information later, leading to poor data quality and missing information. With use of Microsoft Bot Framework together with Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech technologies the field workers are now able to perform these actions using their voice, as they go.
