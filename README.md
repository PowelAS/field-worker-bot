# Field Worker Bot

This is the project created by Powel team during Microsoft Bot Framework Hackfest in Microsoft Norway, Oslo, March 2017. 
The project contains a bot application hosted in ASP.NET Web API and a Xamarin client application. 

## Purpose of the project

Field Worker Bot is a Proof-of-Concept solution for field workers performing electrical grid inspections. In many cases they are not able to add discrepancies to their systems using traditional web or mobile applications, during performing inspections. Because of difficult conditions, like work at height, dirt or frost, they have to add these information later. With use of Microsoft Bot Framework together with Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech technologies the engineer is now able to perform these actions using his voice.
